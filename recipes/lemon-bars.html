            <figcaption>Fiups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
                <il>¼ cup all-purpose flour</il>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To make the crust: Blend 2 cups flour, softened butter, and 1/2 cup sugar in a medium bowl until well combined; press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13-inch pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour in a medium bowl. Whisk in eggs, then lemon juice until smooth; pour filling over the baked crust.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Set the pan aside to cool completely; the bars will firm up as they cool. When cooled, cut into uniform squares.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Dust cooled bars with confectioners' sugar if you like.</p>
            <p>For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and add a drop of green food coloring to create a very pale green. After the bars have cooled, arrange them in a checkerboard fashion.</p>
